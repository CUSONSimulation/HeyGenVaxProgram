# Instructor Quick Reference Guide

## üöÄ Starting a Training Session

### Pre-Session Checklist
- [ ] Verify internet connection is stable
- [ ] Test browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
- [ ] Ensure HeyGen API key is configured
- [ ] Review learning objectives with students
- [ ] Prepare backup discussion questions

### Launch Steps
1. Open terminal in project directory
2. Run: `streamlit run app.py`
3. Browser opens automatically to `http://localhost:8501`
4. Enter API key in sidebar (if not pre-configured)

## üéÆ Simulation Controls

### Phase Navigation
- **Pre-Briefing**: Noa introduces the simulation
- **Main Simulation**: Sam presents as the patient
- **Debriefing**: Noa reviews performance

### Control Buttons
- **Start Simulation**: Initializes avatar connection
- **Next Phase**: Advances to next simulation stage
- **Previous Phase**: Returns to previous stage
- **Reset Simulation**: Clears all progress and starts over

## üë• Avatar Behaviors

### Noa Sandoval (Instructor)

- **Role**: Vaccine-hesitant patient
- **Emotions**: Uncertain, worried, thoughtful
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Vaccine ingredients and safety
  - Effectiveness questions
